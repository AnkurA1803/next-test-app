        "description": "The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a \"gotchas\" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming. Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications. Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology.",

        "description": "About the book: This textbook was written with two primary objectives. The first is to introduce the Java programming language. Java is a practical and still-current software tool; it remains one of the most popular programming languages in existence, particularly in areas such as embedded systems. Java facilitates writing code that is very efficient and powerful and, given the ubiquity of Java compilers, can be easily ported to many different platforms. Also, there is an enormous code-base of Java programs developed, and many systems that will need to be maintained and extended for many years to come. The second key objective is to introduce the basic concepts of OOPs. Hope, It will be helpful. All the Best! -Prem Kumar About the author: Destiny drew Prem Kumar towards computers when the IT industry was just making a big evolution in India.

        "description": "Fully updated to reflect Java SE 7 language changes, Advance Java®, Volume II—Advanced Features, Fifteenth Best Selling Edition, is the definitive guide to Java’s most powerful features for enterprise and desktop application development. \"I was fortunate indeed to have worked with a fantastic team on the design and implementation of the concurrency features added to the Java platform in Java 5.0 and Java 6. Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.\" --Martin Buchholz JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems \"For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. Java Concurrency in Practice provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's--and tomorrow's--systems.\" --Doron Rajwan Research Scientist, Intel Corp \"This is the book you need if you're writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.\" --Ted Neward Author of Effective Enterprise Java \"Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.\" --Kirk Pepperdine CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com \"This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it.\" --Dr. Cliff Click Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems \"I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach. This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of The Java Specialists' Newsletter, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems facing Java developers today.\" --Dr. Heinz Kabutz The Java Specialists' Designed for serious programmers, this reliable, unbiased, no-nonsense tutorial illuminates advanced Java language and library features with thoroughly tested code examples. As in previous editions, all code is easy to understand and displays modern best-practice solutions to the realworld challenges faced by professional developers. Volume II quickly brings you up-to-speed on key Java SE 7 enhancements, ranging from the new file I/O API to improved concurrency utilities. All code examples are updated to reflect these enhancements. Complete descriptions of new language and platform features are highlighted and integrated with insightful explanations of advanced Java programming techniques. You’ll learn all you need to build robust production software with Streams, files, and regular expressions XML Networking Database programming facilities JNDI/LDAP directory integration Internationalization Advanced Swing techniques JavaBeans components Web services Advanced platform security features Annotations Distributed objects Native methods, and more For detailed coverage of fundamental Java SE 7 features, including objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, reflection, events, exceptions, graphics, Swing, generics, collections, concurrency, and debugging,",

These same developers now have more reason than ever to embrace the third edition. That's because the latest release of Java, Java 2E Enterprise Edition, fully supports component development with both CORBA and Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB). Developers need to know how to use both CORBA and EJB to get the most from their Java applications. This how-to book provides in-depth coding examples not just snippets of code and tackles advanced programming issues that enterprise developers face every day.",

With this book, you'll learn the Java language with a unique method that goes beyond how-to manuals and helps you become a great programmer. Through puzzles, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects, you'll quickly get up to speed on Java's fundamentals and advanced topics including lambdas, streams, generics, threading, networking, and the dreaded desktop GUI. If you have experience with another programming language, Head First Java will engage your brain with more modern approaches to coding--the sleeker, faster, and easier to read, write, and maintain Java of today. What's so special about this book? If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. With Head First Java, you'll learn Java through a multisensory experience that engages your mind, rather than by means of a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.",

It offers a quick reference for the reader who has already learned (or is learning) Java from a standard textbook and who wants to know the language in more detail. The book presents the entire Java programming language and essential parts of the class libraries: the collection classes, the input-output classes, the stream libraries and Java 8’s facilities for parallel programming, and the functional interfaces used for that. h written informally, the book describes the language in detail and offers many examples. For clarity, most of the general rules appear on left-hand pages with the relevant examples directly opposite on the right-hand pages. All examples are fragments of legal Java programs. The complete ready-to-run example programs are available on the book’s website. This third edition adds material about functional parallel processing of arrays; default and static methods on interfaces; a brief description of the memory model and visibility across concurrent threads; lambda expressions, method reference expressions, and the related functional interfaces; and stream processing, including parallel programming and collectors. -- Provided by publisher.",

However, given the large number of methods and classes in this library, using them correctly is hardly a cakewalk. Well-known columnist and bestselling author John Zukowski gives the Java professional exactly what he or she needs to know about this vital library in order to maximize productivity. This practical book contains comprehensive coverage of the important Collections Framework from the working programmer's point of view, while staying away from academic abstractions. Java Collections leads you through the standard Java support for maintaining abstract groups of data, from the historical collection classes available since the inception of Java time, through the Collections Framework introduced with the Java 2 platform, and on to third-party alternative libraries for times when the standard support isn't enough. If you're working with data in Java programs, you need to understand the Collections Framework. Let Zukowski's Java Collections be your guide!

In this book, veteran Sun Labs engineer Jim Waldo reveals which parts of Java are most useful, and why those features make Java among the best programming languages available. Every language eventually builds up crud, Java included. The core language has become increasingly large and complex, and the libraries associated with it have grown even more. Learn how to take advantage of Java's best features by working with an example application throughout the book. You may not like some of the features Jim Waldo considers good, but they'll actually help you write better code. Learn how the type system and packages help you build large-scale software Use exceptions to make code more reliable and easier to maintain Manage memory automatically with garbage collection Discover how the JVM provides portability, security, and nearly bug-free code Use Javadoc to embed documentation within the code Take advantage of reusable data structures in the collections library Use Java RMI to move code and data in a distributed network Learn how Java concurrency constructs let you exploit multicore processors",

        "description": "Choice Outstanding Academic Title, 2008. The uniqueness of shape as a perceptual property lies in the fact that it is both complex and structured. Shapes are perceived veridically—perceived as they really are in the physical world, regardless of the orientation from which they are viewed. The constancy of the shape percept is the sine qua nonof shape perception; you are not actually studying shape if constancy cannot be achieved with the stimulus you are using. Shape is the only perceptual attribute of an object that allows unambiguous identification. In this first book devoted exclusively to the perception of shape by humans and machines, Zygmunt Pizlo describes how we perceive shapes and how to design machines that can see shapes as we do. He reviews the long history of the subject, allowing the reader to understand why it has taken so long to understand shape perception, and offers a new theory of shape. Until recently, shape was treated in combination with such other perceptual properties as depth, motion, speed, and color. This resulted in apparently contradictory findings, which made a coherent theoretical treatment of shape impossible. Pizlo argues that once shape is understood to be unique among visual attributes and the perceptual mechanisms underlying shape are seen to be different from other perceptual mechanisms, the research on shape becomes coherent and experimental findings no longer seem to contradict each other. A single theory of shape perception is thus possible, and Pizlo offers a theoretical treatment that explains how a three-dimensional shape percept is produced from a two-dimensional retinal image, assuming only that the image has been organized into two-dimensional shapes. Pizlo focuses on discussion of the main concepts, telling the story of shape without interruption. Appendixes provide the basic mathematical and computational information necessary for a technical understanding of the argument. References point the way to more in-depth reading in geometry and computational vision.",

This book is aimed primarily at researchers in real-time embedded systems, particularly those who wish to understand the current state of the art in using Java in this domain. Much of the work in real-time distributed, embedded and real-time Java has focused on the Real-time Specification for Java (RTSJ) as the underlying base technology, and consequently many of the Chapters in this book address issues with, or solve problems using, this framework. Describes innovative techniques in: scheduling, memory management, quality of service and communication systems supporting real-time Java applications; Includes coverage of multiprocessor embedded systems and parallel programming; Discusses state-of-the-art resource management for embedded systems, including Java’s real-time garbage collection and parallel collectors; Considers hardware support for the execution of Java programs including how programs can interact with functional accelerators; Includes coverage of Safety Critical Java for development of safety critical embedded systems.",

You’ll gain in-depth knowledge of Java application performance, using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the Java platform, including the language and API. Developers and performance engineers alike will learn a variety of features, tools, and processes for improving the way Java 7 and 8 applications perform. Apply four principles for obtaining the best results from performance testing Use JDK tools to collect data on how a Java application is performing Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using a JIT compiler Tune JVM garbage collectors to affect programs as little as possible Use techniques to manage heap memory and JVM native memory Maximize Java threading and synchronization performance features Tackle performance issues in Java EE and Java SE APIs Improve Java-driven database application performance",

        "description": "Your customers want rock-solid, bug-free software that does exactly what they expect it to do. Yet they can't always articulate their ideas clearly enough for you to turn them into code. You need Cucumber: a testing, communication, and requirements tool-all rolled into one. All the code in this book is updated for Cucumber 2.4, Rails 5, and RSpec 3.5. Express your customers' wild ideas as a set of clear, executable specifications that everyone on the team can read. Feed those examples into Cucumber and let it guide your development. Build just the right code to keep your customers happy. You can use Cucumber to test almost any system or any platform. Get started by using the core features of Cucumber and working with Cucumber's Gherkin DSL to describe-in plain language-the behavior your customers want from the system. Then write Ruby code that interprets those plain-language specifications and checks them against your application. Next, consolidate the knowledge you've gained with a worked example, where you'll learn more advanced Cucumber techniques, test asynchronous systems, and test systems that use a database. Recipes highlight some of the most difficult and commonly seen situations the authors have helped teams solve. With these patterns and techniques, test Ajax-heavy web applications with Capybara and Selenium, REST web services, Ruby on Rails applications, command-line applications, legacy applications, and more. Written by the creator of Cucumber and the co-founders of Cucumber Ltd., this authoritative guide will give you and your team all the knowledge you need to start using Cucumber with confidence. What You Need: Windows, Mac OS X (with XCode) or Linux, Ruby 1.9.2 and upwards, Cucumber 2.4, Rails 5, and RSpec 3.5",

The goal of this concise book is not just to teach you Java, but to help you think like a computer scientist. You’ll learn how to program—a useful skill by itself—but you’ll also discover how to use programming as a means to an end. Authors Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield start with the most basic concepts and gradually move into topics that are more complex, such as recursion and object-oriented programming. Each brief chapter covers the material for one week of a college course and includes exercises to help you practice what you’ve learned. Learn one concept at a time: tackle complex topics in a series of small steps with examples Understand how to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and write programs clearly and accurately Determine which development techniques work best for you, and practice the important skill of debugging Learn relationships among input and output, decisions and loops, classes and methods, strings and arrays Work on exercises involving word games, graphics, puzzles, and playing cards",

The authors discuss software engineering processes such as problem specification, modularization, aesthetic programming, stepwise re-finement, testing, verification, and documentation. Besides these topics, software developers also need to understand performance analysis and measurement methods and make choices between data structures and algorithms. Software De-velopment in Java also covers these topics. The authors use Java to teach soft-ware development and for the many examples. Software Development in Java is appropriate for use as a textbook for courses on good software development, introduction to computer science, and advanced programming. It is also a valuable reference book for the experienced program-mer. Software Development in Java is a must for software developers.",
